The Drinklist is essentially a digital tally sheet which is intended for tracking coffee or beverage self-service sales
in offices or communities. It is intended to be used very quickly and with very minimal user interaction. This project
also includes a management view to manage and track the inventory and the sales.

> Drinklist was originally designed and built for the [FIUS](https://fius.de) by its members.

## Prerequisites

* npm
* sqlite3

## Install locally

First install all dependencies and build the typescript sources with:

```shell
npm install
npm build
```

Then start the node js server with:

```shell
npm start
```

or run it directly with:

```shell
node .
# OR
node dist/express/main.js
```

Now go to http://localhost:8080 to start using Drinklist.

## Run with Docker (recommended)

Image: `kienhoefr/drinklist`

Start with mapped config dir and forwarded ports:

```shell
docker run -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" -p 8080:8080 -v ~/drinklistData:/app/data kienhoefr/drinklist
```

You can also run Drinklist using docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  drinklist:
    image: kienhoefr/drinklist
    # You may also use the GitHub registry:
    #image: ghcr.io/kienhoefr/drinklist
    container_name: drinklist
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Change to your liking or don't expose the port when you use an internal reverse proxy
      - 8080:8080
    volumes:
      # Use local bind mount
      - ./data:/app/data
      # Alternatively use docker volume
      #- drinklist-data:/app/data
    environment:
      # Optionally set the containers timezone. As all dates are saved in UTC there is not real need.
      # HOWEVER, it is recommended to set the timezone when upgrading from 1.x, as Drinklist will automatically migrate the database.
      TZ: Europe/Berlin

# When using docker volume to store the data
#volumes:
#  drinklist-data:
#    name: drinklist-data
```

## Upgrading

Updates prior to 2.0 need manual steps to be done when updating. Instructions for these can be
found [here](UPGRADING.md).

When updating to version 2.0, Drinklist will back up all you data files to a `backup` directory in your data folder, so
you can roll back if anything goes wrong.
